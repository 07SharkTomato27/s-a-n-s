This is a modified version of Jcw87's c2-sans-fight, except with harder attacks. All I did was change the attacks, change some text... and clobber the "Infinite Loop Detected" function. So that's that. Oh, this version is online as well; just go to gotoanddie.github.io/c2-sans-fight to play it!
P.S. The final attack will be made harder at a later date. As if you'll ever reach it without using the single attack mode.
